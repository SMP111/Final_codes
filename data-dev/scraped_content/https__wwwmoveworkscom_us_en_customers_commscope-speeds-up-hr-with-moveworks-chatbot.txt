Challenge
 Engaging hybrid employees in a rapidly changing work environment


Result
Deployed an AI platform to provide HR support at scale




















The Problem

    Connecting and engaging with remote employees
  



CommScope is focused on connecting people. That’s why Beth Scholtes, Vice President of HR Tech and Operations, placed particular emphasis on keeping the company’s employees safe, healthy, and engaged, no matter where they work. 
With the sudden transition to remote work in 2020, Scholtes’ number one goal was to help her people find HR information quickly. The challenge was that even with increased investments in portals, knowledge bases, and other tools of the trade, CommScope’s more than 28,000 employees still weren’t able to easily find information. To bring together all these different systems, Scholtes looked to AI and automation.
























The Solution

    Introducing Atlas, CommScope’s HR chatbot
  



In November 2020, CommScope launched Moveworks — better known to the company’s employees as Atlas. Moveworks is an AI solution that instantly resolves both HR and IT questions: Employees simply tell Atlas what they need using conversational language, and the bot handles the rest. Now, employees can access HR policies or reset their passwords, directly on Microsoft Teams.
For Sholtes, one of the primary advantages of Moveworks was its ability to deliver end-to-end resolution, thanks to deep integrations with other systems at CommScope. By pulling information from various backend systems, Atlas can surface personalized HR support without any button-clicking from the service desk — and without any delay for the employee who requested the information.  
Especially in a hybrid world, keeping track of where employees work can be a massive undertaking. With a deeply integrated conversational AI strategy, Atlas can offer up personalized solutions based on where employees are located. This HR chatbot has been able to improve the scope and scale of the company’s HR operations by providing instant help to employees in over 53 countries.















































HR policies can really vary by location. Helping employees find the right information quickly is a great win for us. With Moveworks, we have one place to go for help, and that creates a positive user experience.

The Result

    CommScope brings IT and HR under one roof
  



AI has reshaped every facet of the HR support process at CommScope. For employees, satisfaction with the HR team has skyrocketed, because no one has to wait for help now. But more importantly on the operations side, Scholtes has found that the bot empowers her team to focus on more impactful work — such as finding new ways to engage and support remote employees and improving every step of the employee lifecycle, such as onboarding and recruiting.
At CommScope, AI has been instrumental in creating a positive work environment. Now that people can resolve their HR issues without waiting for help, they’re able to focus on the task at hand without distractions.
