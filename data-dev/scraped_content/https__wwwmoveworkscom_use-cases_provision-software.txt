          Software Access
        









Provide a seamless experience for your users.

The best UI is through your own natural language. It doesn’t matter how your users phrase their questions – whether it’s generic like “ppt please” or hyper-specific like “Please provide me, Madison Smith, access to the software Microsoft Powerpoint” – Moveworks can understand their underlying intent.














Ensure your access workflows are honored.

Whether you’d like to auto-provision software, have IT complete the next final step, incorporate manager approvals, provide a knowledge article, let a user fill out a form, or require them to file a ticket – Moveworks ingests your default workflows and lets you configure them.














Automate the last mile & maintain compliance.

Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth identity & access management system and provides access to users by automatically updating the security group tied to the software. To keep a clean audit trail, Moveworks logs every interaction in your ITSM.                                                                                                                                                        

























    Popular Fully Provisionable Applications
  



Moveworks can provision any application that's supported by your Identity and Access Management System. Below are some of the most popular applications provisioned across our customer base.

Features
Software Access comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and software access management.


Alternative suggestions
License disambiguation
Fuzzy match
Access workflows
Approval notifications













Alternate suggestions
Moveworks uses context from your business to provide different suggestions to users if they ask for software you don’t have.    


















License disambiguation
Help users choose the right applications when multiple kinds of license types are available            


















Fuzzy match
The user can respond in natural language, without needing to click any buttons or copy the exact text of the DL, and Moveworks still understands.          


















Access workflows
Configure logic for approval owners, the information you’d like to collect (including business justifications), automatic provisioning without approvals, and more for each software.


















Approval Notifications
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.






















From accessing software to resetting MFA credentials, 1.Bot means we don't have to have service desk agents working on these requests. Moveworks allows my team to pursue new opportunities and projects that wouldn't have been possible before. And for employees, the time savings are tremendous.
