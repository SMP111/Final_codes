Learn how TC Energy is driving digital transformation with AI.






























Every IT team in the world is now leading a digital transformation initiative, whether that means simply typing up physical documents or deploying advanced AI. But for Chris Foster, CIO at TC Energy, effective digital transformation depends less on “things” than on “ways” — the processes and people driving change within the company.
Chris recently caught up with Moveworks CEO Bhavin Shah to share his success stories of streamlining TC Energy’s operations, including:
How to leverage AI to support employees at speed and scaleHow to ensure robust information security while rapidly innovatingHow to evaluate the impact of new technologies while cutting costs
"Be careful about only engaging in that race to the bottom on costs, because you might win." -Chris Foster, CIO at TC Energy
