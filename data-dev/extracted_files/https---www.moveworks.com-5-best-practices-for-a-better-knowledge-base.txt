5 Best Practices for a Better Knowledge Base
Learn how leading service desks answer employees' IT questions in seconds
Knowledge base (KB) articles allow employees to answer their pressing IT issues quickly, without consulting the service desk. But at most companies, finding those answers is a challenge — with knowledge scattered across multiple repositories, articles filled with technical jargon, and search systems failing to understand what employees need. 
How do top service desks overcome these obstacles? We consolidated insights from IT leaders to create 5 best practices to build a better knowledge base.
