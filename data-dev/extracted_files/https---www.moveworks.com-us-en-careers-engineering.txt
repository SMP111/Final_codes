How our engineering team works magic 
Engineering at Moveworks
Every day when we come to work, we have the freedom to design new solutions for brand new challenges. We’re changing how people find conference rooms, look up forms, and access knowledge articles — in other words, we’re transforming the workplace.
“If you have a great idea, there’s always room to try, and fail. At the end of the day, Moveworks is a place where everybody has the opportunity to grow.”
Eddie Guo
Engineering Manager, Machine Learning
“The answer is never given to you — you have to work for it. And in doing so, you get to define that standard for later generations.”
Haebichan Jung
Data Scientist, Presales
“You have to be creative in computer science. Moveworks allows me to apply both technical skills and creative problem-solving to meet our users' needs.”
Karey Shi
Software Engineer, Machine Learning
“I feel a sense of duty to our customers because their CIOs are making a bet that Moveworks is going to help people.”
Matt Mistele
Software Engineer, Machine Learning
“We're looking beyond what we have today to see what’s next in ML advancements that we can use to continue to advance our conversation engine.”
Lucas Liu
Software Engineer, Machine Learning
Our Engineering Team goes global 
In January 2021, Moveworks opened our second HQ in Bengaluru, India. Our team in India is performing groundbreaking research and development, producing a massive impact on our product. Our award-winning culture and benefits in India keep the team connected to each other and to their colleagues around the world.
Two of our team members, Andrew Mairena, Group Product Manager, and Cody Kala, Software Engineer, share how Moveworks is using AI to triage support tickets.
