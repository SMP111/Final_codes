A radical approach to conversational AI design.
Leveraging cutting-edge generative AI and large language models to dramatically simplify building unique conversational AI use cases. Provide just a few sample utterances, and let our platform do the rest.
No more model training or scripting.
The conversational toolkit approach has proven to be cumbersome, brittle, and ultimately unscalable for the enterprise — it’s time for disruption.
Fast enough for every creator.
Let anyone on your team get to building in a matter of minutes – not days, months, or years – for any use case imaginable.
Composed of a comprehensive set of workspaces.
Whether you want to generate fluid, yet highly controlled conversations with Paths; create structured data lookups across any enterprise system with Queries; or develop proactive, actionable, and business critical alerts with Events — Creator Studio empowers your developers and service owners to build any use case.
Paths Workspace
Queries Workspace
Events Workspace
Say goodbye to scripting, decision trees, and IVA.
Create fluid yet highly controlled conversations.
Using generative AI, leveraging expert and agent notes as input and conversation stories as output. Help your employees surface an answer, kick-start a workflow, or be directed to another resource.
Explore Paths
No more waiting around for data.
Query data from any system, any department, anytime.
Provide employees access to any system, in any department, in any language. Allow your employees to concentrate on their work, not on navigating the dozens, if not hundreds, of systems across your enterprise.
Explore Queries
Never let business critical alerts fall through the cracks again.
Surface actionable alerts for employees right where they work.
Keep your business running more smoothly than ever, allowing your service owners and developers to surface business critical, actionable alerts for employees — ensuring they never miss a notification again. Save time, reduce costs, and turbocharge productivity for your employees.
