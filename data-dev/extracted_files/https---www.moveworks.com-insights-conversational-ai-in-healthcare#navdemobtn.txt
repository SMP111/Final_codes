Conversational AI represents a technological breakthrough that stands to benefit healthcare greatly. But before exploring its many use cases, it's essential to clarify precisely what conversational AI is.
At a basic level, conversational AI allows for natural, human-like interactions between computers and users. It utilizes advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to comprehend free-form human speech or text input. This is vastly more sophisticated than simple chatbots, which rely on scripted responses.
True conversational AI has the flexibility and intelligence to respond appropriately to an infinite array of possible conversational scenarios. It can maintain context, ask clarifying questions, and handle complex interactions. Over time, conversational AI systems continuously improve through machine learning.
Healthcare organizations implementing conversational AI are seeing improvements in efficiencies, access, costs, retention, and patient satisfaction by automating routine administrative tasks, freeing up staff for higher-value work, and more. 
Conversational AI represents a new paradigm in human-computer interaction. This technology will soon become an indispensable tool for delivering modern healthcare. With this in mind, let’s look at some of the top use cases for conversational AI in healthcare.

How does conversational AI work in healthcare?
When we talk about the healthcare sector, we aren’t referring solely to medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, medics, etc., but also to administrative staff at hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. 
Healthcare organizations like hospitals and clinics deal with a high volume of inquiries and requests from staff on a daily basis. These can range from administrative questions to issues with IT systems to guidance needed for patient care. During times of crisis like COVID-19, the flood of questions and the need for support skyrockets. This results in overwhelmed help desks and staff wasting time toggling between different systems or tracking down information.
Conversational AI provides a solution by automating responses to many routine, repetitive questions and tasks. With natural language capabilities and integration with backend systems, conversational AI-powered assistants, known as AI copilots, can act as support agents using advanced models to understand requests, analyze data, and deliver solutions.
Powered by large language models (LLMs), these copilots possess deep knowledge across various systems and domains across a healthcare organization. They can respond contextually to a wide array of possible questions and conversations. And over time, the copilots continuously improve through machine learning.
The healthcare sector can undoubtedly benefit tremendously from such AI-driven customer care automation. Leading healthcare institutions have already implemented AI-powered copilots in partnership with Moveworks to improve their organizations' day-to-day and the patients they serve.
