The Problem
    Vituity’s focus: stopping problems before they happen
Now more than ever, the healthcare sector is tasked with delivering high-quality care, the moment it’s needed, at enormous scale. As one of the largest acute care providers in the United States, Vituity is committed to meeting that standard for the 6.5 million patients it serves each year. A partnership of nearly 5,000 physicians leads and owns Vituity, all of whom depend on advanced technology to combat a global health crisis such as COVID-19. 
This reliance on technology means that supporting patients and supporting physicians are deeply related challenges, because when something breaks, both patients and physicians are left waiting for help. Vituity’s CIO Amith Nair realized that automation had become a necessity to eliminate disruptions for physicians — in real time.
The Solution
    Automating IT support with Otto
In April 2020, Vituity deployed the Moveworks bot, which its physicians know as Otto. Otto is an AI-powered chatbot that lives on Microsoft Teams, Vituity’s messaging platform. The bot has completely transformed how physicians get help: Rather than waiting days, they now get answers in seconds.
Crucially, Otto doesn’t just understand what users need; it automates every step of the support process. Powered by the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™, Otto deeply understands physicians’ requests, maps them to solutions across Vituity’s entire digital infrastructure, and delivers just the relevant snippet. 
And because it’s learned the company’s unique org chart, every answer is personalized according to the user’s role, location, and security permissions. By making it possible for employees to solve their own IT problems proactively and quickly resolve any issues that do arise, Vituity is empowered to exceed their employees' expectations.
This is personal to me: Healthcare needs serious tech disruption. COVID-19 made us realize that we couldn’t help the patients who need us without fixing our own systems and processes.

The Result
    Proactive IT support, powered by comms
One challenge for any distributed workforce is communicating change from afar. Like many other organizations, Vituity’s previous approach to communication was mass email, a format that struggled to keep the entire organization on the same page:
“Most company comms today are sent in emails,” said Nair. “Guess what: No one reads emails! That’s why we’re shifting most of our comms strategy to using Moveworks over chat. It’s about making sure our messages go to the right people on the right platform, so they actually get read.”
Now with Moveworks for Employee Communications, Vituity’s leaders can send targeted, interactive messages that are the opposite of mass emails. The bot automatically sends messages to the relevant users on Microsoft Teams, handles follow-up questions, and reports on engagement in real time. 
This ability to send targeted messages means preventing issues before they happen, freeing up both physicians and support teams for high-value work. The ideal future for Nair is making Otto the single point of contact for any issue, employee, or partner. 
“Automation and AI are at the core of our support strategy,” said Amith. “Ultimately, where we’re headed is that Otto can solve every issue for every employee.”
