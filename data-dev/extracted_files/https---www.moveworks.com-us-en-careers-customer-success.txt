 How our Customer Success Team works magic 
Customer Success at Moveworks
Everyone on our Customer Success Team is a strategic leader. We serve as the face of Moveworks for iconic companies like LinkedIn, DocuSign, and Broadcom, where we work with teams of senior leaders from across departments.
“We're doing more than just coming in and saying let's implement Moveworks. We’re actually implementing a much broader organizational change and restructuring the way that their employees think about work.”
Sofie Zarrabi
Area Director, Implementation
“I get to come in every day and see the future of technology — of work. I know that somewhere down the line, I'm going to see a smile on the face of a customer when they get to experience that too.”
Dave Uppal
Vice President, Professional Services
“We’re setting the gold standard for customer success. Our team is very customer-oriented, but we’re also all product experts. That’s why our customers say they love engaging with our Customer Success team.”
Neal Vasan
Regional Director, Professional Services
Gwen Thorn, Vice President, Customer Success
Gwen drives value across the Moveworks customer base. Prior to Moveworks she spent five years at Box, Inc., where she focused on optimizing Customer Success and building out the Business Development partnership with IBM.
Gwen has a B.A. in Global Studies from University of California, Los Angeles.
