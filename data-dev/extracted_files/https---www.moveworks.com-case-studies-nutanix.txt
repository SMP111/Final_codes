Time it took for Nutanix to implement its AI strategy
Challenge
Modernizing legacy IT support process that caused costly delays
Result
After implementing AI, mean time to resolution (MTTR) was reduced from days to seconds
The Problem
    Nutanix’s innovation challenge for enterprise IT
Wendy Pfeiffer, CIO,  joined Nutanix with a focus on improving the employee experience of IT and adopting more automation to bring gains in productivity and efficiency. 
Despite using state-of-the-art ITSM tools, the process for employees to get access to applications, or to get help resolving issues, was broken. Simple application requests would sit in the queue for hours before an agent reviewed them. Delays caused by email communication between agents and employees meant that it could be more than a week before the employee finally got access to the application.
The Solution
    An AI implementation strategy focused on fast time to value
In less than 2 months, Nutanix launched Moveworks in the form of X-Bot. Moveworks’ combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU) enables X-Bot to resolve employees’ IT support issues conversationally, directly in their enterprise messaging platform without any training or behavior change. This centralized way of answering commonly asked questions, combined with easy integration with Nutanix’s ITSM solution and other systems of record, allows X-Bot to transform tedious tasks into painless conversations that last only a few seconds.
In the past, simple application requests would typically sit in a help desk queue for seven hours before an agent reviewed it. And it could take an additional day of agent’s time collecting business justifications, chasing approvals, and carrying out admin tasks. But with Moveworks, these requests are being resolved autonomously in just a few seconds.
“With Moveworks, backend systems get pushed to the background — so employees don’t have to know they exist,” said Pfeiffer. “They just have this delightful, modern AI layer that communicates with them and solves their problems, right there and then.”
With Moveworks the results were immediate. We had a delightful user experience and improved productivity across the company within the first few days of rolling it out, not weeks or months later. Moveworks is a rare breed of technology that immediately provides value back that we can invest in other areas of IT.

The Result
    Fast support across the enterprise
Moveworks allowed Nutanix to realize extremely rapid time to value with the implementation of autonomous AI that resolves IT issues for employees. Unlike other AI solutions, the Moveworks AI platform comes pre-trained with enterprise IT knowledge so Nutanix didn’t need to invest time training or configuring the platform.
While Nutanix’s initial focus was on autonomously resolving IT issues with AI, Pfeiffer now hopes to use the Moveworks platform to improve employee support across the enterprise. But already, by resolving more than half of all IT issues with no involvement from the help desk, Nutanix has accelerated workflows, supercharged productivity, and boosted satisfaction throughout the company.
“Moveworks is a rare breed of technology that immediately provides value back that we can invest in other areas of IT,” Pfeiffer said.
