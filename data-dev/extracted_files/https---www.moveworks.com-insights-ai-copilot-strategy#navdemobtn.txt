As AI continues to develop rapidly, copilots will play an increasingly vital role in helping users streamline their tasks and better use their digital resources. In light of this, defining a well-structured copilot strategy becomes essential for businesses aiming to harness the full potential of AI technology. 
What does it take to build a copilot-like experience into your enterprise?
Before developing an AI copilot strategy, you need to understand what it takes to build a copilot-like experience into your enterprise. There is a vast difference between ChatGPT and an enterprise copilot platform that is fully integrated within an organization. This is not to say that ChatGPT isn’t helpful. It is incredibly helpful for certain use cases. But it’s limited in its ability.
For a copilot to own more enterprise-focused tasks, you need a less general, more tailored approach that can manage:
Domain-specific requirements: Understanding the unique needs, challenges, and objectives of each department involved in the copilot is crucial. That includes a wide range of enterprise service needs — identity, permissions, security, compliance, and more.
Relevant data inputs: The key to building a copilot is to gather and process relevant data specific to each domain. This requires a team of annotators to provide tags, descriptions, ratings, translations, and well-researched examples so the copilot can provide the best possible support.
System integrations: Connect the copilot to the right tools, technologies, and systems for each department, ensuring seamless collaboration across domain-specific applications.
Custom AI models: Fine-tune the LLMs according to domain-specific data sources, desired outcomes, and unique challenges specific to each domain for more accurate decision-making.
Strong analytics and data science team: Staff with expertise in data analysis and machine learning development are required to support the copilot's learning and optimization and ensure that the experience improves over time instead of degrading.
Consistent, intuitive user experience: To maintain a straightforward and seamless interaction with the copilot, you need a conversational AI system that lets users easily take full advantage of its capabilities.
Robust security infrastructure: Especially for an enterprise copilot, engaging with security experts to safeguard sensitive enterprise data, protect user privacy, and adhere to necessary compliance measures is mandatory.
Given the above, it should be clear that incorporating a copilot experience into your organization takes considerable effort. While some use cases might be lighter lifts, others will require heavy, long-term maintenance. The scope of the problem you’re trying to solve will require varying degrees of investment. For example, using AI to provide enterprise-wide support will, by definition, need a much better understanding of and investment in the bullets above than using AI to write web copy. 
Figure 1: When looking at AI copilot use cases, we start to see the relationship between the scope of the problem and the investment required to solve it, enabling decision-makers to make informed choices when embracing LLMs for their organizations.
This is to say that an AI copilot is not something you can build and maintain on your own, particularly if you want to expand its functionality across the enterprise. Investing in the right partner with the right resources is the key to successfully implementing a helpful and efficient AI copilot.
The four-tiered AI copilot strategy framework
We created a four-tiered framework to help leaders better understand the technology and investments necessary to integrate LLMs into production environments.
