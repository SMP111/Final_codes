The Problem
    Albemarle seeks to unlock employee potential with AI
Albemarle is a global chemical company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, with 6,000 employees worldwide. As the world’s largest lithium manufacturer, Albemarle is essential to the production of everything from rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles to grid-scale energy storage. 
Patrick Thompson, Chief Information & Digital Transformation Officer at Albemarle, understands more than most that the CIO plays an integral role in shaping the future of work. 
“I have to think beyond business-as-usual,” said Thompson. “Putting efficiency first, aligning closely with other support-focused teams, and establishing a data-driven strategy — that’s what matters to me right now.”
Thompson and Alok Singh, Director of IT Automation and Collaboration at Albemarle were constantly working to create a more efficient, more productive workplace, but they had no real way of knowing what was slowing their employees down.
The Solution
    Albemarle goes all in on ALbot
In April 2021, Albemarle launched ALbot, a Moveworks chatbot that lives on Microsoft Teams. Now when employees need help, all they have to do is ask. Powered by the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™, ALbot understands requests, determines the right response, and takes action across Albemarle’s digital infrastructure — anytime, anywhere.
Today, ALbot engages conversationally in over one hundred languages, automatically resolves thousands of employees’ requests, provisions software, fills out forms, unlocks accounts, and most importantly, shows the Albemarle team which levers to pull to improve the employee experience.
Most importantly, Moveworks offers Employee Experience Insights (EXI) — an analytics solution that uses breakthrough techniques in natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning to uncover the issues slowing employees down the most. 
Moveworks’ natural language understanding provides profound insight into what’s holding our people back. When we know exactly which teams and regions are feeling the most pain, we can focus our efforts and get those employees back on their feet.

The Result
    Albemarle sees impact with Employee Experience Insights
With Employee Experience Insights, Albemarle can now turn thousands of requests into a simple, actionable to-do list. While current ITSM insights tools focus primarily on tickets and SLAs, EXI focuses on employees’ everyday experiences. It offers Albemarle’s support leaders granular insights about each employee persona — allowing them to see and address inefficiencies across the company immediately.
In Singh’s words: “Moveworks has opened brand new territory for us. ALbot’s natural language understanding has revealed a vision for how we can transform Albemarle’s employee experience. 
At first, we thought that no one solution could be the answer, but Moveworks can really do it all."
