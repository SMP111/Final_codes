Conversations with the Moveworks bot
Challenge
Automating personalized support for over 26K healthcare employees without overextending IT                                        
Result
Employees self-service their own support, engaging in over 100K one-on-one conversations with their Moveworks bot
The Problem
    Wellstar wanted to put its people first
Dianne Kokotoff, Executive Director of Enterprise Solutions and Automation at Wellstar, wanted to extend Wellstar’s focus on specialized support to the company’s employees. But building a better employee experience wouldn’t be as simple as updating a few policies.
At Wellstar, the question was not choosing to automate but choosing how to automate. Like many organizations before them, Kokotoff and her team’s options were to either manually build out a solution using a conventional chatbot “toolkit” or find an option that works out of the box. And they needed ROI fast.
Valued team members, from frontline medical professionals to IT, were burning out, just from dealing with frustrating tech problems. That’s why Kokotoff and her team were looking for a solution that could be up and running fast.
Kokotoff and Larry Ross, the ServiceNow manager, wanted a super personalized, conversational support experience. But creating a homegrown chatbot with this level of sophistication would require a monumental amount of work upfront, work their team was not equipped to manage. To do this, they’d need a partner like Moveworks.
The Solution
    An AI chatbot that works out of the box
In May 2020, Wellstar deployed its Moveworks bot, better known to the team as WALi. Powered by the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™, chatbot WALi delivered ROI on day one — understanding company lingo, automatically syncing with backend systems, and adapting to user feedback — so the IT team is free to focus on other priorities instead of constantly maintaining dialog flows. 
Today, WALi ensures employees get the help they need through natural conversations. Whether a frontline worker is locked out of their account or an office-based admin has a question about a new policy — the bot understands each request, determining the most relevant solutions in seconds.
Quote, Author, Company: “I’ve built bots, and I’ve bought bots. Unless you have a huge development team, I recommend you buy. That way, you can get all the expertise, the knowledge, the wisdom, and the talent of the people involved.” — Larry Ross, ServiceNow Manager, Wellstar
I’ve built bots, and I’ve bought bots. Unless you have a huge development team, I recommend you buy. That way, you can get all the expertise, the knowledge, the wisdom, and the talent of the people involved.

The Result
    The best employee experience puts people first
Kokotoff and Ross have made a concerted effort to always think about the end-user first, instead of just clicking boxes. This approach is harder than the status quo, but it’s certainly paid off. 
By investing time and energy into building the best employee experience — not manually building a bot — they were able to launch a chatbot that genuinely helps their employees do their best work and delivers ROI instantly.
