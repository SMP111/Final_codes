With tools like ChatGPT continuing to push the boundaries of what’s possible, businesses across the globe are rapidly adapting to AI-driven solutions.
Artificial intelligence (AI) copilots are a particularly fascinating advancement in today’s digital technology landscape. They can do it all — whether it’s helping you draft an email, answering specific questions, or guiding you through a complex B2B sales process.
With all the things that AI copilots can do, there are times when they almost seem like magic. And that makes them a source of confusion for the people looking to take advantage of this new technology.
The truth is that AI copilots are simply a tool that you can use to level up your digital experience. Albeit, a powerful one.
That said, what exactly are AI copilots? How do they work? And when should you be using them to level up your business conversations?
We answer all those questions — and more — in this introductory guide to copilots.
>> Learn how to build an AI copilot strategy that works for you. Check out our webinar!
What is an AI copilot?
An AI copilot is a conversational interface that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in various tasks and decision-making processes across multiple domains within an enterprise environment. By leveraging LLMs, AI copilots possess the capability to understand, analyze, and process vast amounts of data.
AI copilots play a crucial role in enhancing productivity and efficiency by: 
Providing context-aware assistance: AI copilots can proactively respond to user needs based on contextual information, ensuring relevant and timely support during critical decision-making processes.

Unifying disparate systems: AI copilots can be the cohesive force connecting multiple platforms, tools, and software applications under one umbrella, ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and compatibility across the enterprise. 
In a nutshell, an AI copilot acts to simplify complex tasks and provide valuable guidance and support, ultimately elevating the user experience and driving businesses toward their goals effectively and efficiently. As AI copilots continue to evolve with enhanced capabilities and deeper integration into enterprise ecosystems, they hold the potential to redefine the way businesses operate and compete in the coming years.
What is an enterprise AI copilot?
An enterprise copilot is a fluid conversational interface that connects your employees with every business system. It’s built on hundreds of machine learning models, fine-tuned to your enterprise data. Available across every channel and fluent in more than one hundred languages, your enterprise copilot makes it easier than ever for your employees to get things done.

Why is an enterprise AI copilot needed?
As businesses become increasingly complex and rely on a myriad of software solutions, employees often face the challenge of navigating and managing diverse systems. Traditional, isolated solutions often fall short of resolving cross-system communication problems, that may lead to reduced productivity and inefficiencies. An enterprise AI copilot is the answer to overcoming these challenges. 
By integrating all enterprise systems under a single conversational interface, employees can access information and complete tasks more efficiently. The AI copilot simplifies collaboration, making it easier for employees to excel in their functions and significantly boosting overall productivity.
How do AI copilots work
AI copilots have strong foundations built on two essential components: artificial intelligence and integrations across systems. 
AI algorithms applied in natural language processing, context understanding, and machine learning enable copilots to predict user needs and provide informed suggestions. Through integrations, AI copilots can interact with a vast range of systems, creating a unified, interconnected platform for seamless communication and task management. 
When trying to understand how AI copilots work, it’s important to take note of the four-tiered AI copilot strategy framework in order to understand its strengths and limitations. 
Tier-one AI copilots leverage basic API calls to LLMs as the main part of their AI infrastructure. This allows for an easy lift and low barrier to entry. While these copilots offer lots of general information, they lack domain-specific knowledge, which can lead to hallucinations.
Tier-two AI copilots involve a customized implementation of a fine-tuned LLM grounded in an organization’s data. While this is a slightly higher lift, the outputs are more customized to the organization and improve security and privacy. They are limited to single-step use cases and can get limited performance due to relying on a single LLMs outputs.
Tier-three AI copilots involve chaining multiple LLMs together, creating sophisticated pipelines optimized for multi-step use cases that leverage the strengths and capabilities of each LLM involved. In this way, tier-three AI copilots can tackle a broader range of use cases, enhance productivity and efficiency, and address challenges in more sophisticated domains.
Tier-four AI copilots work to address the challenges inherent in providing extensible employee support and facilitating autonomous decision-making. As a sophisticated LLM system specifically designed for enterprise-wide deployment, these tier-four copilots encompass advanced features like a reasoning engine, analytics, security, and privacy, as well as out-of-the-box connectors catering to the demanding requirements of large organizations.
The performance and functional difference between a tier-one and tier-four AI copilot is staggering, which is why enterprise AI copilots fall into the latter category. They require a sizable investment in capital, personnel, advanced understanding of key machine learning techniques, and a deeply integrated platform that spans the entire enterprise ecosystem.
