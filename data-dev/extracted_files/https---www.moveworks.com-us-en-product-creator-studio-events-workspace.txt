Never miss a single beat
Moveworks makes it simple for you to keep up with events in every enterprise system. Every time a contract is ready to send out or your laptop is due for an upgrade, our API messages your employees directly in chat.
Meet employees where they are
Your employees each have a unique way they work. Some are on Slack while others use email. Events workspace simplifies multi-channel messaging, letting you reach users on their preferred platform.
Integrate with any system in seconds
You don’t need a team of experts to set up integrations in Events workspace. Our API is simple yet powerful, able to support thousands of messages every minute across every system, from Salesforce to Workday.
Create smarter automations with Dynamic Flow
Automations need to adapt to your ever-changing environment, but rule-based systems just can’t keep up. Moveworks’ Dynamic Flow gets the right users the right answer every time.
The possibilities are endless
