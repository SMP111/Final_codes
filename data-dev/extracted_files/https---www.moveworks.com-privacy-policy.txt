    Policies  
    Our Privacy Policy
Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Moveworks, Inc. (“Moveworks”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). The Site is operated by Moveworks and provides information about our company and our conversation-based, issue resolution product and related service (the “Service”) to our Site visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Moveworks’ policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that we collect from visitors to the Site and users of the Service. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site, and, to the extent not superseded by our customer’s privacy policies, to the Service.
    Information We Collect
When you interact with the Moveworks Site or Service, we collect Personal Data and other information from you. If your organization uses the Service, we collect your personal information about you from your organization's identity and access management system (“Organizational Directory”).
    Personal Data You Provide Through the Site and Service
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Site, or use the Service. Wherever Moveworks collects Personal Data through the Site, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are giving Moveworks consent to use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Moveworks and Moveworks’ authorized third parties located in the United States.
    Personal Data We Collect From Your Organization
If your organization uses the Service, Moveworks collects personal information about you from your Organizational Directory, such as Active Directory or Okta, including your name, your organizational email address, your organizational telephone number, and Organizational Directory information about you.
    Personal Data We Collect From Other Sources
We may collect personal information about you from other sources including third parties from whom we purchase Personal Data from publicly available information. These may include your name, business email address, business telephone number, job title and department, company name, business related postal address, and social networking URLs. We may combine information you provide with data we collect from third parties. We use this information to create more tailored advertising to provide services that may be of interest to you. 
    Other Information We Collect
    Usage Data
We collect information when you use the Service, including actions you take in the Service and the messaging conversations you have with the Service. This helps us improve the performance of our machine learning models and make your experience better.
    Non-Identifiable Data
When you interact with Moveworks through the Site or Service, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Moveworks may store such information and include it in databases owned and maintained by Moveworks affiliates, agents or service providers. As an example, we may use such information and pool it with other information to track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No Personal Data is made available or used in this process.
In operating the Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. Most web browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you. Please refer to your browser’s Help section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site features.
    Aggregated Personal Data
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Service, Moveworks often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Moveworks may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Moveworks may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Service to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
    Location Information
We may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Site or Service. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section.
    Analytics and Tracking Technologies
We may, and we may allow Third Party Providers to, use cookies (as noted above) or other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Site. For more
information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
Our Site currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.
    Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Moveworks uses Personal Data in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data for that reason only. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Site or Service, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Moveworks and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Service, to better understand our users and to improve the Service. Moveworks and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
If Moveworks intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
    Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information
Moveworks is not in the business of selling your information. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
    Business Transfers
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.  
    Related Companies
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    Your Employer
If you are using the Service in connection with your role as an employee or contractor of a company or other legal entity, we may share your information with such entity.
    Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties
Moveworks, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function and we are liable to you for any onward transfers of Personal Data made by those other companies to their subcontractors and third-party agents.
    Legal Requirements
Moveworks may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Moveworks, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
    Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Moveworks other than Personal Data collected through the Site and Service.

This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Moveworks shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site or Service. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Moveworks through the Site or Service, please contact us at privacy@moveworks.com, and we will delete that information from our databases.
    Links to Other Websites
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Moveworks’ Site and Service. They may contain links to other web sites or services not operated or controlled by Moveworks (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Service do not imply that Moveworks endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
    Security
Keeping your data secure is important. Moveworks follows current industry standards to protect your Personal Data while that data is in transit and at rest in our data storage. We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site and Service from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. No network or email transmission is fully secure or guaranteed to be error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Site or Service may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing Personal Data to Moveworks. If you have questions about the security of our Service, please contact us at security@moveworks.com.
