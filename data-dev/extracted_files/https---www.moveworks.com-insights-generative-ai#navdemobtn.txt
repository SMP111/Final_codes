What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data, such as images, music, or text. It uses algorithms to learn patterns and produce new content that mimics the style and structure of existing data. 
For example, if you give a Generative AI model a few lines of poetry, it can use that to create an entirely new poem with similar themes and language. It's like having a virtual artist or writer that can come up with new ideas and content off the cuff.
How does Generative AI work?
Generative AI learns patterns from existing data, then uses this knowledge to generate new and unique outputs. 
Unlike traditional AI models designed to classify or predict based on existing data, Generative AI creates new data from scratch. It's like having a machine that can dream up new ideas and concepts without human intervention.
The key to Generative AI is using large language models, typically trained on massive datasets — think entire collections of books and vast amounts of web content — to understand and generate content with impressive fluency.
But what sets Generative AI apart are its core strengths: extraction, summarization, and generation.
Extraction refers to the ability of a Generative AI model to sift through large datasets and identify relevant patterns and trends that may be difficult for human analysts to spot.Extraction allows Generative AI to act as an entity detection or keyword detection model capable of detecting and isolating specific pieces of information, such as entity names or keywords, from a given dataset.
Summarization refers to using Generative AI to produce a condensed version of a longer text such as an article, report, or document. Given a long piece of text, it can summarize the meaning of the text in fewer words and then provide a brief to the reader.This capability has already come to life in many applications, starting with call summarization and note-taking applications such as Microsoft Teams' premium offering.
Generation refers to creating new data or content from scratch quickly and easily. From producing music and images to writing novels and even developing apps, Generative AI is transforming how we create. This capability has already been leveraged by various standalone applications such as  Jasper AI and Writer and more recent developments in document writing applications like Coda and vertical applications like Microsoft Dynamics 365. 
What kinds of output can a Generative AI model produce?
Generative AI models can produce a wide variety of output, including text, images, audio, and video. Let's take a look at some examples.
Generative AI examples

Similarly, GE has used Generative AI to design and optimize 3D-printed fuel nozzles for gas turbines, resulting in nozzles that are 25% lighter and five times more durable than previous designs.
Marketing: Generative AI can create highly personalized content that resonates with individual customers. By analyzing customer data such as browsing history, purchase behavior, and demographic information, Generative AI can create targeted messages, ads, and other marketing materials. For example, a travel company could use Generative AI to create customized travel itineraries based on a customer's preferences and travel history. This level of personalization can lead to increased engagement and conversion rates, as customers are more likely to respond positively to content tailored to their interests and needs.
Coding: Coding is an area where Generative AI can be particularly useful, as it can help automate software development by generating code based on natural language inputs.OpenAI's Codex is a Generative AI model that can generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions of programming tasks. This can be particularly useful for programmers who are unfamiliar with a particular programming language or need to quickly prototype code.To offer another example, Moveworks gives enterprises a conversational interface that works across every system — from Microsoft to Workday to Salesforce. The company uses Generative AI to translate natural language into workflows. This helps to speed up the development process and reduce the workload of human developers. 
Design: Generative AI is transforming the field of graphic design by generating custom designs for logos, websites, and other visual content. By analyzing existing designs and data, Generative AI models can create new designs that are unique, eye-catching, and tailored to specific needs.For example, Looka is a Generative AI tool that creates custom logos for businesses using machine learning algorithms to generate design options based on customer preferences. Another example is Canva, which uses Generative AI to suggest design layouts, font pairings, and color palettes for its users.
Entertainment: Generative AI has transformed the entertainment industry by allowing creators to generate new and original content quickly and easily. With the ability to create scripts for movies, TV shows, or video games and develop new music, Generative AI is changing the way we think about creative expression. For example, the music streaming platform Amper Music uses Generative AI to compose and produce original music for its users, while the AI-based writing platform, ScriptBook, can analyze and generate predictions for a script's potential commercial success.In the video game industry, Ubisoft has used Generative AI as an AI “ghostwriter” tool to write dialogue for some games to keep non-playable characters individually interesting and realistic with less manual work.
Writing: Generative AI has shown the ability to write books and stories by using natural language processing to create coherent and engaging text. ChatGPT is one example of an AI model capable of generating written content. It has been used to write books such as Alice, a children's book illustrated entirely by Generative AI.
