          Groups Access
Provide a seamless experience for your users.
The best UI is through your own natural language. It doesn’t matter how your users phrase their questions – whether it’s generic like “edit a list” or hyper-specific like “Please remove Marc Thompson from the sales@acme.ai email distribution list” – Moveworks can understand their underlying intent.                                                                                   
Ensure your approvals workflows are honored.
Whether it’s creating a new list, adding themselves or others, or removing themselves or others, Moveworks incorporates your existing group access configuration and allows you to modify them.        
Automate the last mile & maintain compliance.
Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth email systems and provides access to users by automatically updating the group. To keep a clear audit trail, Moveworks logs every interaction in your ITSM.
Features
Groups Access comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and distribution list management.
Generic request disambiguation
Fuzzy match
Approval workflows
Approval notifications
Removal notifications
Generic request disambiguation
If the user doesn’t specify which group, Moveworks provides options through chat-modal forms and lets the user decide.
Fuzzy match
The user can respond in natural language, without needing to click any buttons or copy the exact text of the DL, and Moveworks still understands.          
Approval workflows
Configure logic related to an employee’s role (e.g. “is manager”), an existing group member, and group owner, automatic provisioning without approvals, and more for each list.
Approval Notifications
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.
Removal notifications
Users who get removed from a distribution list from someone else automatically receive notifications in chat.
From accessing software to resetting MFA credentials, 1.Bot means we don't have to have service desk agents working on these requests. Moveworks allows my team to pursue new opportunities and projects that wouldn't have been possible before. And for employees, the time savings are tremendous.
