For a long time, chatbots suffered from a negative reputation, primarily due to their frequent misunderstandings of user requests. Many users, subject to the limitations of primitive, script-bound chatbots, longed to speak to live agents who could comprehend their needs the first time around. 
Recognizing this frustration, artificial intelligence (AI) developers sought solutions to harness the technology's distinguishing capacity to learn and evolve continually, ultimately setting it apart from static, code-dependent software. By tapping into AI's potential, researchers aim to reach the state of dynamic communication tools and leave rigid chatbots behind.
This adaptability employs high-quality annotated data, a crucial ingredient for developing representative, successful, and unbiased AI models. 
Data annotation, the often unsung hero of AI, is the key to reaching excellence. It plays an indispensable role in advancing intelligent conversational AI and fostering chatbots that respond to human language naturally and intuitively.
In this blog post, we aim to illuminate the intriguing world of data annotation and highlight its significance in teaching chatbots to interact seamlessly with users.
We’ll cover:
What data annotation is and why it’s important
The role annotators play
The main data annotation techniques
Data annotation applications, including in the enterprise
The limitations of data annotation
Best practices for data annotation
What role AI annotation will play in the future
What is data annotation?
Annotation provides much-needed context and categorization for machine learning models to extract valuable insights by way of assigning labels to raw data. In this process, a taxonomy — a system of classification — is applied to systematically organize and classify data.
Data annotation is the backbone of modern AI applications. Its primary function is to help machines comprehend and interpret various forms of data such as text, video, images, or audio. Thanks to this methodical annotation, AI systems can process different types of content effectively.
More specifically, text annotation can be broken down into various tasks, including but not limited to:
Semantic annotation: Associates meanings to specific portions of a text, facilitating natural language understanding (NLU). 
Intent annotation: Identifies the ultimate goal or user needs within user input for improved conversational AI. 
Sentiment annotation: Categorizes emotions expressed in the text, enabling sentiment analysis for chatbots. 
As mentioned, annotation encompasses more than just textual formats. For instance, image or video annotation may include classification, which entails categorizing images according to their content; object recognition, which involves identifying and locating specific objects within images or video frames; image segmentation, the process of dividing an image into regions representing distinct objects or areas of interest; and boundary recognition, to further refine object identification.
In this blog, we'll primarily concentrate on text annotation, as it aligns with Moveworks' objective of comprehending and interacting with enterprise language. However, please note that annotation is crucial to the advancement of all AI, particularly with the ongoing development of large multimodal models that are able to engage with images, audio, and more.
Why is data annotation important?
Before getting into the importance of data annotation, let's first acknowledge the inherent challenges posed by the ambiguity of human language. 
People articulate their needs in vastly diverse ways — concise or lengthy, jargon-filled or formal. And on top of that, a user’s goals carry more specificity than any taxonomy you apply to them. With seemingly infinite possibilities to convey a message or pose a question, humans can still effortlessly communicate, as they are naturally adept at comprehending linguistic nuances.
But for an untrained AI system, deciphering the essence of such communications can be an arduous task. To illustrate this challenge, consider a colleague who shares a meandering story about their vacation and how they could not access the company portal due to poor Wi-Fi service. Despite various HR-related keywords such as “vacation” and “time off”, a human reader or listener would quickly infer that their issue was an IT problem, not an HR problem. 
An untrained bot, in contrast, might struggle to prioritize the most relevant keywords. This is precisely where data annotation steps in. Training AI models on high-quality, annotated data allows them to grasp the complexity and diversity of natural language, separate the signal from the noise, and focus on the most critical aspects of user input.
This becomes particularly important when attempting to predict user's needs based on a chosen taxonomy. Through maintaining a manageable level of granularity in the annotation process, we can improve the decision-making skills of our AI. This method contrasts with approaches used by some, where they assign a single intent to each piece of content, say a knowledge base article, which could lead to reduced productivity and clarity in understanding users' needs via a proliferation of intents.
In turn, AI systems and chatbots can accurately respond to a wide range of human communication with minimal effort. Data annotation empowers AI to comprehend the nuanced symptoms users describe and connect them with solutions, cutting through linguistic complexities and delivering elegant solutions. 
To sum up, data annotation is an essential component in creating AI systems capable of providing meaningful user experiences. The impact of data annotation spans industries and use cases, significantly enhancing the capabilities and practicality of AI-powered solutions across the board.
What is the role of annotators?
An AI annotator's role is to systematically review and label different data types, translating human language and inputs into machine-understandable formats. Your brain most likely would automatically determine that if you try your password incorrectly too many times, you may need your account unlocked, but machines require annotated data to effectively learn patterns, make sense of data, and adapt their responses. 
Annotated data is particularly crucial for training large language models (LLMs), as their key purpose is to digest, interpret, and generate human-like conversation. Focusing on intent annotation, we define “intent” as the ultimate goal or user need. Intent annotation acts as a bridge between human language and machine language. Annotators review real messages sent to chatbots (utterances) and user-submitted tickets. We do this review while protecting personal and sensitive information, incorporating the principles of privacy by design and by default. 
Annotators label these user inputs using a taxonomy that the bot understands and can map to its corresponding actions. For instance, a password resetting issue might be labeled with "Reset Authentication," which triggers the bot's specific skill. Through intent annotation, annotators teach the AI system to recognize patterns in seemingly disparate phrasings and accurately respond to meet users’ needs.
What are the main data annotation techniques?

Data annotation limitations
Data annotation can be hindered by challenges such as cost, accuracy, and ambiguity. Here’s a quick run-through of these limitations and the ways annotators and enterprises can work together to overcome these obstacles.
Cost
One of the primary challenges encountered in data annotation is the financial cost associated with hiring and training annotators. Investing in annotators ensures high-quality annotations that lead to improved AI system performance. Striking a balance between securing adequate resources for annotators and managing organizational constraints is essential for maintaining an efficient annotation process.
Accuracy
Ensuring the accuracy of annotated data is crucial for the efficacy of AI models. Mislabeled datasets can negatively impact AI performance, leading to undesirable outcomes, such as incorrect predictions or responses. Annotators and enterprises must continuously monitor and maintain the quality of annotations to ensure AI models are trained on the most accurate, current, and relevant data.
Ambiguity
One of the greatest challenges of annotation is dealing with ambiguity. Words, acronyms, and abbreviations can have multiple meanings. Annotators are able to consider the organization and the industry that the utterance or ticket they are evaluating originated from, which can help narrow things down. The same acronym could be referring to a particular form at one organization but an internal software tool at another. 
In some cases, annotators are able to reference more specific customer language resource documents in order to classify a resource type of a potentially ambiguous term with more accuracy. The type of company a user works for can also be important to consider when determining intent. 
For example, while at most organizations served by Moveworks utterances discussing health insurance are likely to fall into our “Benefits” Resource label, if we know the organization is a health insurance provider we may need to read deeper into the utterance to determine if it is about insurance being provided to an external client.
Contextual awareness
Further complicating annotation is the fact that each utterance can be considered individually, without the context of the conversation history. Annotators must then assess and annotate single utterances without having this context, which can occasionally make it difficult to infer the intended meaning. 
Ambiguity is added when messages are cut off by a user hitting Enter too soon, or in cases where a user is referencing something previously discussed with vague terms such as “it” instead of naming the actual resource. In these cases, annotation can feel like an exercise in mind reading, but expert annotators are typically able to make educated guesses based on their experience reviewing similar utterances.
Disagreement resolution and quality control
Disagreement resolution is a process of addressing both annotator errors and valid interpretive differences in opinion, ensuring data consistency, as well as refining guidelines. By analyzing differing interpretations of user inputs, annotators can improve annotation quality. 
Historically, collecting multiple opinions and resolving disagreements has helped us correct annotator errors, identify ambiguous inputs, and refine project documentation. This process has also led to better taxonomy definitions, minimizing biases while enabling the AI to ask clarifying questions when needed. 
In pursuit of efficiency, the Moveworks team has reduced time spent on disagreement resolution, instead aiming for an 85% organic agreement rate. Continuous improvements have resulted in consistently reaching or even exceeding this goal, achieving high-quality data to train AI models effectively.
What are some best practices for data annotation?
